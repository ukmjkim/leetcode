[Question]
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

[Solution]
Algorithm

Approach: Binary Search

The problem is basically asking the maximum length of consecutive number that has the running sum lesser or equal to `n`. In other word, find `x` that satisfy the following condition:

`1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + ... + x <= n`
`sum_{i=1}^x i <= n`
Running sum can be simplified,

`(x * ( x + 1)) / 2 <= n`
Binary search is used in this case to slowly narrow down the `x` that will satisfy the equation. Note that 0.5 * mid * mid + 0.5 * mid does not have overflow issue as the intermediate result is implicitly autoboxed to double data type.
