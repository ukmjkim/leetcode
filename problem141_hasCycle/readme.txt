[Question]
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

[Solution]
Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm or tortoise and hare algorithm


1    ->    2   ->   3   ->   4  -> 5
                 /               /
                8    <-  7  <-  6
